Created by Youssef Elashry to allow two-way communication between Python3 and Unity to send and receive strings

Feel free to use this in your individual or commercial projects BUT make sure to reference me as: Two-way communication between Python 3 and Unity (C#) - Y. T. Elashry
It would be appreciated if you send me how you have used this in your projects (e.g. Machine Learning) at youssef.elashry@gmail.com

Modified by: 
Youssef Elashry 12/2020 (replaced obsolete functions and improved further - works with Python as well)
Based on older work by Sandra Fang 2016 - Unity3D to MATLAB UDP communication - [url]http://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/bb979228.aspx#ID0E3BAC[/url]
